# Reflection on HTML CSS landing page



## Main Concepts Applied

- **Semantic HTML Elements**: The use of semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` improves the document's structure and accessibility, making it easier for both users and search engines to understand the content.

- **Navigation Structure**: The navigation menu is created using an unordered list (`<ul>`), allowing users to easily access different sections of the website, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Product Presentation**: The products are displayed in a grid format using `<div>` elements, each containing an image, title, and price, which provides a clear and visually appealing way to present product information.



## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

- **Grid Layouts**: Gained experience in structuring content using grid layouts, which are essential for organizing multiple items (like products) in a visually appealing manner.

- **Responsive Design Awareness**: Improved understanding of how to create a layout that can adapt to different screen sizes, which is crucial for modern web design.

- **Use of External Resources**: Learned how to incorporate external resources, such as CSS for styling and scripts for icons, enhancing the functionality and aesthetics of the webpage.



## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

- **Semantic Structure**: Initially, there was uncertainty about how to effectively use semantic elements. This was resolved by researching HTML5 best practices and applying appropriate tags to enhance the document's structure.

- **Styling Integration**: Without the accompanying CSS file, predicting the visual outcome was challenging. This was managed by creating a basic layout and planning for future CSS integration to improve the design.

- **Image Sourcing**: Finding appropriate images that fit the product descriptions while ensuring they are properly licensed posed a challenge. This was addressed by using freely available image sources and ensuring proper attribution when necessary.
