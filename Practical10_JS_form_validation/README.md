# Basic Form Validation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple web form that collects user information, including their name, email, and password. The form includes client-side validation to ensure that the user inputs are correct before submission, enhancing user experience by providing immediate feedback.

## Features
- **User  Input Fields**: The form includes three input fields:
  - Name
  - Email

- **Client-Side Validation**: JavaScript is used to validate the inputs before submission, ensuring that the data entered meets specific criteria.
- **Error Handling**: Any validation errors are displayed dynamically, guiding users to correct their input.

## Structure
The HTML document is structured as follows:
- **Head Section**:
  - Contains metadata, including character set and viewport settings.
  - Links to an external CSS file for styling.
- **Body Section**:
  - Displays a heading for the form.
  - Contains the form with input fields and a submit button.
  - Includes a paragraph element for displaying error messages.
