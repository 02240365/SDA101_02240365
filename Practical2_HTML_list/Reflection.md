# Reflection on HTML list



## Main Concepts Applied

- **HTML Structure**: The use of semantic HTML elements like headings (`<h2>`), unordered lists (`<ul>`), and ordered lists (`<ol>`) enhances the document's readability and organization.

- **Document Metadata**: The `<head>` section contains meta tags for character set and viewport settings, ensuring proper display across different devices.

- **Styling Link**: An external CSS file (`list.css`) is linked, indicating a separation of content from presentation.

- **List Usage**: Effective use of both ordered and unordered lists to categorize and present information clearly.



## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

- **Semantic HTML**: Gained a deeper understanding of semantic elements and their role in improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

- **List Formatting**: Learned the appropriate use of ordered and unordered lists to organize information logically and clearly.

- **Document Structure**: Improved ability to logically structure a document, ensuring that each section is distinct and easy to navigate.



## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

- **List Formatting**: There was initial confusion regarding the use of `<br>` tags within lists, which is not standard practice. This was resolved by removing the `<br>` tags and utilizing CSS for spacing instead.

- **Semantic Clarity**: Ensuring that headings and lists accurately represented the content was challenging. This was addressed by revisiting the content structure and adjusting headings to better reflect the organization of information.

- **Styling Considerations**: Without visibility into the CSS file, it was difficult to predict the final layout. This was managed by testing the HTML in a browser and making iterative adjustments based on visual feedback.
