# Reflection on HTML table



## Main Concepts Applied

- **HTML Structure**: The document is organized using semantic HTML elements, including headings (`<h2>`) and tables (`<table>`), which improve the readability and structure of the information presented.

- **Table Elements**: The use of table rows (`<tr>`), headers (`<th>`), and data cells (`<td>`) allows for a clear and organized presentation of data, making it easy to compare information across different categories.

- **Accessibility**: By using table headers, the document enhances accessibility, allowing screen readers to provide context for the data being displayed.




## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

- **Table Design**: Gained a deeper understanding of how to structure tables effectively to display data in a logical and user-friendly manner.

- **Semantic HTML**: Learned about the importance of using semantic elements in tables to improve accessibility and clarity for users and search engines.

- **Data Organization**: Improved ability to organize information systematically, ensuring that related data is grouped together for easier comprehension.




## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

- **Table Structure**: Initially, there was confusion about how to properly format the table rows and headers. This was resolved by reviewing HTML table documentation and experimenting with different structures until the desired layout was achieved.

- **Data Alignment**: Ensuring that the data within the table cells was aligned properly posed a challenge. This was addressed by utilizing CSS (planned for future implementation) to control the alignment and spacing of table elements.

- **Responsive Design**: Without CSS for styling, the table's responsiveness on different devices was a concern. This was managed by planning to implement responsive design techniques in the future to ensure the table displays well on various screen sizes.
