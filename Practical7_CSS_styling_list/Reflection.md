# Reflection on HTML CSS styling list



## Main Concepts Applied

- **HTML Structure**: The document is structured using semantic HTML elements, including headings (`<h1>`), ordered lists (`<ol>`), and unordered lists (`<ul>`), which enhance readability and organization.

- **List Elements**: The use of ordered and unordered lists allows for clear presentation of main events and their details, making it easy for users to navigate through the information.

- **Class Usage**: The application of classes (e.g., `Events`, `circle`) for styling purposes demonstrates an understanding of how to apply CSS for visual differentiation, even if the actual styling is not included in this snippet.



## New Skills or Knowledge Gained

- **List Structuring**: Gained a better understanding of how to effectively use ordered and unordered lists to present hierarchical information in a clear and concise manner.

- **Semantic HTML**: Improved knowledge of semantic HTML practices, which contribute to better accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

- **Event Organization**: Learned how to organize and categorize events logically, making it easier for users to find relevant information.



## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

- **List Formatting**: Initially, there was confusion about the correct nesting of lists. This was resolved by reviewing HTML documentation and ensuring that each sub-list was properly nested within its corresponding main list item.

- **Styling Implementation**: Without the accompanying CSS file, predicting how the lists would visually appear was challenging. This was managed by planning to implement CSS styles in the future to enhance the visual presentation of the events.

- **Content Organization**: Ensuring that each event's details were clearly presented required careful organization of the list items. This was addressed by outlining the information beforehand and structuring the HTML accordingly.
